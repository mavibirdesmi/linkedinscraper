# linkedinscraper

* Uses chromedriver and Google Chrome so please ensure that your Google Chrome version and chromedriver version is same or very close. 
* This script uses the specified parameters in the parameters.py, so if you want to change something please control parameters.py
* The count for getting linkedin accounts is not limited but it can be limited through linkedin.com or if there is not enough search results
<br>
If your internet is slow please increase the delay time from the parameters.py or you may get empty spaces even though there is information on the user's linkedin page. Otherwise please decrease the delay since it will hugely impact your working time if your count is very high.

All the procces happens in one tab so hopefully chrome will not affect the overall performance of the system

Have fun!
